Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure the SSI0 peripheral on the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to function as an SPI master. It sets up GPIO Port A pins (PA2–PA5) for SPI signals and transmits data using bare-metal embedded C programming with direct register access.

Features
SPI master mode setup via SSI0

GPIO Port A (PA2–PA5) configured for SPI functions

8-bit data transmission using Freescale SPI frame format

System clock and SSI0 clock prescaler configured for SPI timing

Bare-metal register-level programming, no external libraries
